27-year-old web developer, passionate about technology and always enthusiastic about tackling new challenges. 

After a first education and career in finance and management consulting, I changed careers and learned web development at Le Wagon in Paris. I have since kept improving my skills through personal projects

I am eager to continue improving my skills, and therefore currently looking for opportunities in back-end or full-stack development.

Currently learning React.js, Django and Korean

Stack:
- Back-end: Ruby, RoR, Python
- Databases: SQL, PostgreSQL, Redis
- Front-end: HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, Tailwind, JavaScript, Stimulus JS, React
- Git
- Deployment: Heroku, Scalingo
